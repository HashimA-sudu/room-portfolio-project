#Hashim's Portfolio
--
Hi, thanks for visiting my repo! You'll find all files associated with the project right here.

To run the project locally, you'll need to run `npm run dev` in the terminal after navigating to the directory of the project. 

This project was heavily inpired by Andrew Woan's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6sulUMRGE) which had pretty much everything i needed and is absolutely a great video tutorial. Don't be deterred by the video's length, I've worked on this project on and off for a long time which is why it took me almost two months. After completing the project now any future portfolio will be a lot easier because of the experience gained.

Also, you'll see a folder called `blender_project` which houses all blender files used to generate the final model of the project.
