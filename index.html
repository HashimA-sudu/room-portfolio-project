        <p class="modal-paragraph">Was this hard? Absolutely. Modeling, UV mapping, unwrapping, baking, debugging—all outside my expertise. But once I got the hang of it, it became genuinely fun.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="modal-paragraph">$ echo "Would I recommend this project?"</p>
        <p class="modal-paragraph">> Yes! It teaches you invaluable skills and self-reliance. The hardest part is starting and staying consistent.</p>
