      <p class="modal-paragraph">Hi! I'm Hashim Alshawaf, a full stack computer science student at King Faisal University with a big passion in learning, 
        particularly in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, video game development, the Japanese language, and more!
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently working on getting an internship by January, any interested company may contact me by email at HashimHamadAlshawaf(at)gmail(dot)com</p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">This project was heavily inspired by Andrew Woan's Room Portfolio video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6sulUMRGE" target="_blank">(you can watch it here)</a></p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">Was this a hard project? Needless to say, yes it was. Modeling, adjusting UV maps and unwrapping, baking, rebaking. All of these were areas outside my
      expertise and had to debug by myself. So of course it was hard. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">But it was pretty fun once I got the hang of it. The hard part was the beginning and making sure to continue working on this project.
        <br>
        <br>
        Would I recommend someone try to do this project? Absolutely! this gives you experience in some great programs and makes you self reliant!
