      <p class="modal-paragraph">Hi! I'm Hashim Alshawaf, a full stack computer science student in King Faisal University with a big passion in learning, 
        particularly in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, video game development, the Japanese language, and so much more!
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently working on getting an internship by January, any interested company may contact me by email at <br>
        HashimHamadAlshawaf(at)gmail(dot)com
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">This project was heavily inspired by Andrew Woan's Room Portfolio video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB6sulUMRGE" target="_blank">(you can watch it here)</a></p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">Was this a hard project? Needless to say, yes it was. Modeling, baking, rebaking, adjusting UV maps and unwrapping. All of these were areas outside my
        expertise and had to learn from scratch. So of course it was hard. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">But it was pretty fun once I got the hang of it. The hard part was the beginning and making sure to continue working on this project.
        <br>
        Would I recommend someone try to do this project? Absolutely! this gives you experience in some great programs and makes you self reliant!
